- [ ] Find a way to manage secrets
  - Evaluate:
    - Public repo with encrypted secrets
    - Public repo (base) + Private repo (encrypted secrets, wrapper)
    - Can I use Bitwarden?

- [ ] Have a standard `kit-runtime-setup` command to do setup that doesn't belong to nix config
  - Creating files that should not be in `/nix/store`
    - Like `~/.ssh/nix_config` is symlinked
    - Like `~/.ssh/config` import the above and is writable by user
  - Copies k3d connection information etc.
  - Showing instructions for how to do system setup in case the system is only home-manager based
  - Should probably have `--dry-run` (changes that are going to be made), `--diff` (what has changed on disk)
  - Be careful to not lose user files. Always, always, always backup!
